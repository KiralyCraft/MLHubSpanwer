# UBB's MLHub Spawner Plugin for JupyterHub (TLJH Variant)

This repository contains the source code for UBB's MLHub spawner plugin, designed for The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) variant. It enables machine learning users to access high-performance machines through JupyterHub, providing them with powerful computing resources tailored for ML workloads.

The machines need to also have 'jupyterlab' installed for this to work. 

TODO: Document more about the host setup

## Features
